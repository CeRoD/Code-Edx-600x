### Code for L3 Problem 5 ####
## This are just pieces of code
## and you will heve to answer some questions
## about it.

### Just see the variations in the code and how that
## can change the result.

## First one:
iteration = 0
count = 0
while iteration < 5:
    for letter in "hello, world":
        count += 1
    print("Iteration " + str(iteration) + "; count is: " + str(count))
    iteration += 1 

## Second one:
iteration = 0
while iteration < 5:
    count = 0
    for letter in "hello, world":
        count += 1
    print("Iteration " + str(iteration) + "; count is: " + str(count))
    iteration += 1 

## Third one:
iteration = 0
while iteration < 5:
    count = 0
    for letter in "hello, world":
        count += 1
        if iteration % 2 == 0:
            break
    print("Iteration " + str(iteration) + "; count is: " + str(count))
    iteration += 1
